# Iris Classification

The best small project to start with on a new tool is the classification of iris flowers

The [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris) for the project was taken from the great UCI Repository.

**_Objective._** We are going to create a model which could fit the data about what classes of them iris flowers and make some predictictions on their class.
 
 This data set became a typical test case for many statistical classification techniques in machine learning such as support vector machines

#This is a good project because it is so well understood.

- Attributes are numeric so you have to figure out how to load and handle data.
- It is a classification problem, allowing you to practice with perhaps an easier type of supervised learning algorithm.
- It is a multi-class classification problem (multi-nominal) that may require some specialized handling.
- It only has 4 attributes and 150 rows, meaning it is small and easily fits into memory (and a screen or A4 page).
- All of the numeric attributes are in the same units and the same scale, not requiring any special scaling or transforms to get started.
